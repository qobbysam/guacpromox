                    DESKTOP VM USER GUIDE
================================================================================

Welcome to the Remote Desktop System!

This document explains how to use the shared desktop environment with
pre-configured Chrome browser sessions.

================================================================================
ACCESSING THE DESKTOP
================================================================================

1. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   https://your-domain.com/guacamole/

2. Log in with your provided username and password

3. You'll see a list of desktop VMs you have access to

4. Click on a desktop to connect

5. The remote desktop will load in your browser

================================================================================
USING CHROME BROWSER
================================================================================

LAUNCHING CHROME:
-----------------
You'll find a "Chrome (Shared Config)" icon on the desktop.
Double-click it to launch Chrome with pre-configured accounts.

WHAT'S PRE-CONFIGURED:
---------------------
• Gmail/Google Workspace accounts
• Salesforce
• Slack
• Other business applications
• Browser extensions
• Bookmarks

YOU ALREADY LOGGED IN:
---------------------
When you open Chrome, you'll be automatically logged into all configured
accounts. No need to enter passwords!

YOUR SESSION IS PRIVATE:
-----------------------
• Your tabs are yours alone - other users can't see them
• Your browsing history is separate
• Your downloads are isolated
• Your current work is private

SHARED ACROSS SESSIONS:
----------------------
• Account logins (Gmail, Salesforce, etc.)
• Bookmarks
• Saved passwords
• Browser extensions
• Preferences

CONCURRENT ACCESS:
-----------------
Multiple users can work on the SAME desktop VM at the same time!

Example:
• You open Chrome and access Gmail
• A coworker also connects to the same desktop
• They also open Chrome and access the SAME Gmail account
• You both work independently without conflicts

================================================================================
BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

DO:
---
• Use the desktop as you normally would
• Open Chrome from the desktop shortcut
• Save your important work frequently
• Log out when finished for the day

DON'T:
------
• Don't try to log out of shared accounts (Gmail, Salesforce, etc.)
• Don't change browser settings that affect other users

================================================================================
